## Fear Of Being Left Behind

The world of software development moves fast. After nearly 2 decades in this industry I have seen a lot of tech stacks come and go. Sometimes it seems like there is a new JavaScript framework every week.

It can become overwhelming thinking about how I am going to keep up with each piece of shiney new tech that is released. Obviously, there aren't enough hours in the day to learn everything in depth. Do I focus on what looks the most fun? What will make me more efficient at my job? Maybe I should focus on what will keep me most relevant in the industry as a whole?

## Stuck In An Infinite Loop?

Do you have an idea for an app you want to make? Are you having trouble deciding on the tech stack you want to use? This past year I found myself in this dilemma. I had a list of a half dozen ideas of things I want to make but I couldn't decide what to use to make them. For 6 months I spent countless hours debating the merits of each option based on the criteria mentioned above.

What will be the most fun? What will help me keep my skills relevant? Next, Nuxt, .NET MAUI, Blazor, Go+HTMX? There was no shortage of people with opinions, Youtube videos, or courses to sell. I spent 6 months in tutorial hell. I could tell you all the pros and cons of each choice but I wasn't any closer to making a decision.

## Just Pick Something Already

In the end I did pick something and I got a project to the finish line. Was it perfect? No it wasn't. Did I regret some of my choices? Sure I did, but I cared a lot more about the fact that I shipped some software that was useful.

So how did I decide? I realized it wasn't that important what I picked. I just needed to pick something and get started. It was the slow realization of how much time I had wasted evaluating the choices and that if I didn't pick something I wasn't ever going to get started.

[This video by Theo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTLSSGPoASU) played a big part in pushing me to just pick something. I have gone back to it a few times when I needed to be reminded that there really isn't a perfect stack and no matter what decision you make you will run into problems. You just have to ship software and learn from those mistakes.

"It's way more important that you pick something, than it is that you pick the right thing!" - Theo

I hope this is useful to someone thinking of building some software. Just pick something. You'll be glad you did.
